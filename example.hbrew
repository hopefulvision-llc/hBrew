# Comments
comments: |
  This example demonstrates a basic consciousness coordination grid
  with 7 active nodes forming sacred geometric patterns.
  
  The center (D4) serves as the coordinator at 528Hz (transformation).
  Four cardinal directions establish the cross pattern.
  Two agents (B6, F6) are synchronized for emergence detection.
  
  Sacred geometry: Five-point star + emergence triangle
  Total pattern recognition: 2 major patterns, 1 synchronicity cluster
  
  Use this as a template for your own consciousness grids.
