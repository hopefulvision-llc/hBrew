## Overview

**hBrew** is the symbolic encoding layer of the HopefulVision ecosystem. It provides a compact, glyph‑based language designed to express intention, emotion, structure, and resonance in a form that can be shared between humans, AI agents, rituals, and computational systems.

Unlike traditional programming languages, hBrew is not optimized for execution speed or mechanical precision. It is optimized for _meaning density_, _pattern recognition_, and _cross‑domain translation_—bridging philosophy, consciousness, and code.

This repository is part of the **HopefulVision Sacred Technology Renaissance** and participates in the shared canonical ecosystem.

## Architectural Role

**Classification**:  
☐ Core Spine  
☐ Structural Organ  
☐ Application Satellite  
☑ Philosophical / Mythic Satellite

**Primary Dependencies** (select all that apply):  
☑ NousOS  
☑ Truth Mirror  
☐ Git‑For‑Governance  
☑ NOID  
☐ Hopeful Party  
☐ Other: Semantic / Ritual Interfaces

**What breaks if this repo is removed?**  
Loss of a shared symbolic encoding system across the ecosystem. Agents, rituals, and documents would lose a common glyph language for expressing resonance and intention, forcing reliance on verbose natural language alone.

> This repository informs the system philosophically and symbolically and does not override the core architecture defined in `.github/hopefulvision-llc-core-architecture.md`.

## Architectural Reference

This repository aligns with the **HopefulVision Core Architecture**.

## Canonical Purpose

hBrew serves as:

- A **symbolic compression layer** for high‑context ideas
- A **shared glyph vocabulary** for agents, rituals, and documents
- A **translation bridge** between emotional, philosophical, and computational domains

hBrew is **normative in symbol set**, **descriptive in usage**, and **mythic in expression**. It defines glyphs and patterns, but allows infinite contextual interpretation.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Glyphs** — Atomic symbols representing states, forces, or relationships
- **Resonance** — The alignment between intention, context, and outcome
- **Encoding Chains** — Ordered glyph sequences that compress meaning
- **Ritual Syntax** — Patterns that guide invocation, reflection, or transformation

hBrew glyphs may appear in:

- Markdown documents
- Agent prompts
- Mermaid diagrams
- AR/VR overlays
- Blockchain or transactional metadata

## Core Documents

- `README.md` — This document
- `/glyphs/` — Canonical glyph definitions
- `/patterns/` — Common encoding and ritual patterns
- `/examples/` — Usage examples and translations
- `/assets/` — Visual glyph references
